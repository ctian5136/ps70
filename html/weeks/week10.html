            <h3>Facial Recognition Rubber Band Shooter</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                This week, Bobby, Lane, and I worked together to create a facial recognition rubber band shooter that takes
                in the input from a computer camera, writes to a database, and then shoots a rubber band with a servo motor controlled mechanism after reading 
                a value from the database.

                    </li>

            <h4>Assembly</h4>
            <h5>Rubber Band Shooting Mechanism</h5>
            <p> Lane assembled the rubber band mechanism. To create one that can be controlled by a microcontroller, he attached
                a servo motor with a spoked attachment to a piece of wood that would then stretch the rubber band out. The servo
                was also connected to an ESP32 that would control it. See images below for details on how the mechanism was created.

            </div>

            <h5>Camera Facial Recognition Mechanism</h5>
            <p> To create our input, which was a facial recognition system, Bobby first started out with the ESP CAM, but then switched to using the camera built into his computer, along with a python script.

            </div>
            <br>
            <h5>Firebase and ESP communication</h5>
            <p> I worked on the communication of the two ESP32's through a Firebase Realtime Database. The ESP32 connected to the facial recognition system
                would write to the database a boolean value (either true or false) when it detected a face. The ESP32 connected to the servo motor would then read from the database
                and if the value was true, it would shoot the rubber band. Below is the code for writing and reading to the database.
